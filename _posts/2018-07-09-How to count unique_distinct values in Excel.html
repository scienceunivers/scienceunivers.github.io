  如何计数不重复的单元格。包括计算只出现一次的值的个数，计算互不相同值的个数。  -->

  <blockquote>
    When working with datasets in Excel, you may often need to know how many duplicate and unique values are there. And sometimes, you may want to count only the distinct values.
    For the sake of clarity, let's define the terms first.
    <br>
    Unique values - these are the values that appear in the list only once.
    <br>
    Distinct values - these are all different values in the list, i.e. unique values plus 1st occurrences of duplicate values.

    Yes, there's already a fancy <a href="https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2016/04/07/how-to-count-distinct-and-unique-values-in-excel/">blog</a> clarifying this problem so well that there's no need writing a new one. I'll just do some notes on this blog.
    
    list of names |  unique   |  distinct
    --------------------+---------------------------
    Ronnie        | Ronnie    |  Ronnie  
    David         | Sally     |  David
    Sally         | Jeremy    |  Sally
    Jeremy        |           |  Jeremy
    Robert        |           |  Robert
    David         |           |  
    Robert        |           |

  <h1><a id="link-to-anchor-1">Count unique values</a></h1>
  <p>
    Supposing you have a column of names like the above in your Excel worksheet(name Ronnie starts at cell A2), and you need to count unique names in that column. The solution is to use the SUM function in combination with <code>IF</code> and <code>COUNTIF</code>:
    <code class="languange-excel formula">=SUM(IF(COUNTIF(range, range)=1,1,0))</code>
    <br>
    Note. This is an array formula.
  </p>
  <div>
    How the Excel count unique values formula works? The confusing point is <code>COUNTIF</code>. In this example, COUNTIF(A2:A10,A2:A10) returns the array {1;2;2;1;2;2;2;1;2}, representing the counts of each name.
    <br>
    Recall the grammar of IF: =IF(logical_test, [value_if_true], [value_if_false]), the IF function evaluates each value in the array returned by COUNTIF, keeps all 1's (unique values), and replaces all other values with zeros, it returns an array too, so the function IF(COUNTIF(A2:A10,A2:A10)=1,1,0) becomes IF({1;2;2;1;2;2;2;1;2} = 1,1,0), which means if value in array equals to 1, then return 1, else 0, reserving the unique value. Here the blog made a mistake that it lost the curly bracket around array, instead it uses round brackets to enclose it, which is wrong and very misleading.
    <br>
    Finally, the SUM function adds up the values in the array returned by IF and outputs the total number of unique values, which is exactly what we wanted.
  </div>
  <p>
    Next the blog talks about how to Count unique text values in Excel, simply add <code>ISTEXT</code> function: <code class="language-excel formula">=SUM(IF(ISTEXT(A2:A10)*COUNTIF(A2:A10,A2:A10)=1,1,0))</code>. Since the asterisk (*) works as the AND operator in array formulas, if the value is text then it is keeped. The same for counting unique numeric values.
  </p>  
  <h1><a id="link-to-anchor-2">Count distinct values in Excel (unique and 1st duplicate occurrences)</a></h1> 
  <p>
    The blog gives the formula as <code class="language-excel formula">=SUM(1/COUNTIF(range, range))</code>, eg. <code>=SUM(1/COUNTIF(A2:A10,A2:A10))</code>, also an array formula.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    As you already know, we use the COUNTIF function to find out how many times each individual value appears in the specified range. In the above example, the result of the COUNTIF function is the following array: {2;2;3;1;2;2;3;1;3}.
    <br>
    After that, a number of division operations are performed, where each value of the array is used as a divisor with 1 as the dividend. This turns all duplicates values into fractional numbers corresponding to the number of duplicate occurrences. For example, if a value appears 2 times in the list, it generates 2 items in the array with a value of 0.5 (1/2=0.5). And if a value appears 3 times, it produces 3 items in the array with a value of 0.3(3). In our example, the result of 1/COUNTIF(A2:A10,A2:A10) is the array {0.5;0.5;0.3(3);1;0.5;0.5;0.3(3);1;0.3(3)}.
    <br>
    When one of these functions adds up the values in the array, the sum of all fractional numbers for each individual item always yields 1, no matter how many occurrences of that item exist in the list. And because all unique values appear in the array as 1's (1/1=1), the final result returned by the formula is the total number of all different values in the list.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    So to count distinct values, we exploit the feature that the addition of reciprocals of distinct counts equals to 1, sum all these 1s, we get final number of distinct values.
    <br>
    If you want to exclude blank cells, just add <code>&lt;&gt;""</code>, eg. <code class="language-excel formula">=SUM(IF(B2:B50&lt;&gt;"",1/COUNTIF(B2:B50, B2:B50), 0))</code>.
  </p>
  <h1><a id="link-to-anchor-3">Using FREQUENCY and MATCH</a></h1>
  <p>
  <a href="https://www.excelforum.com/excel-formulas-and-functions/931374-counting-unique-cells-totally-excluding-duplicate-values.html">Counting unique cells - totally excluding duplicate values</a> puts up another way to count unique values.
  <br>
  <code class="language-excel formula">=SUM(IF(FREQUENCY(MATCH(A2:A8,A2:A8,0),ROW(A2:A8)-ROW(A2)+1)=1,1))</code>
  <br>
  This is also an array formula, <code>MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type])</code>, if match_type is set to 1, <code>MATCH</code> finds the first value that is exactly equal to lookup_value. The values in the lookup_array argument can be in any order. So the output of <code>MATCH(A2:A8,A2:A8,0)</code> would be {1;2;3;4;5;2;5}.
  <br>
  Syntax of FREQUENCY is <code>FREQUENCY(data_array, bins_array)</code>, <code>ROW(A2:A8)-ROW(A2)+1</code> would simply be {1;2;3;4;5;6;7}, aiming to act as the interval(bins_array) in FREQUENCY, facilitating to count the frequency of names, as for {1;2;3;4;5;6;7}, it will count numbers less or equal to 1, greater than 1 but less or equal to 2, ... so on. The output would be {1;2;1;1;2;0;0}, if all the names are unique, then there must be 1 count in each interval, in our case, it has some difference.
  <br>
  So the outcome of <code>IF({1;2;1;1;2;0;0}=1,1)</code> is {1;0;1;1;0;0;0}, you sum them up, get the number of unique values. The drawback of this method is that it requires there be no blank cells.
