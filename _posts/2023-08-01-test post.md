title: How To Install Ubuntu In Another Partition With Windows Xp Already In One Partition
---

In 2018, I needed installing a Ubuntu to implement a risk model. I'd like to mark it down for memory or just fun. 

Most blogs are about installing Ubuntu on a fresh computer (tutorial.ubuntu.com), restoring OS (wiki how), installing Ubuntu along with windows OS (to cram them into one partition or use windows 10's self contained mechanism, see lifiwire.com for an example), installing Ubuntu in a VM (linus.nci.nih.gov), etc. Few mentioned how to put Ubuntu and windows xp into two seperate partitions, which is today's theme.
