<h1><a id="link-to-anchor-1">Background</a></h1>
<p>
It's always troublesome when starting from scratch. When I took this risk alert system 1.0, I can hardly believe how messy it is, including the machine this system is running on, which is lenovo thinkcenter M8500t-N000, a very crude PC as the server. I can vaguely recall that it has a RAM about 4G, with 3 other 4G RAM sticks overall as suppliments. There's also a problem in the connection between the monitor and housing, causing the computer screen color being wierd. 
  <br>
The most awkward situation is that the hard disk is soon being full, it has 1 TB space, 30-50G left spare. Usually my monthly routine is that I extract one month data package (in the form of sql), output their file names into another sql file, then import all the data into the server.
</p>
<h1><a id="link-to-anchor-2">Action</a></h1>
First, output all the sql file names into one sql file so that you can source them into the server as a whole. Use dir command( ref the DOS doc), choose the appropriate path as you want, 
  <br>
  <code>
    dir >E:\MarData\export.sql
  </code>
  <br>
  <!--不能用<pre><code>了，段落间距太大，而且有些额外的渲染，比如没文字的一行也会用code css来渲染一下，很难看。
  -->
Open export.sql, add key words "source + directory(where you store all the data file that is in the form of sql)" at the beginning of each line, then add command suffix at the end (which is ; in the case of mysql, ultraedit and notepad++ are  recommended),then start up the Microsoft terminal services client,  log onto the server, and execute codes below, to load the item-by-item data into the server: 
<pre>
  mysql -uroot -p*****
  use &lt;the database name&gt;; 
  tee E:/MarLog.txt;
  source E:/MarData/import.sql;
</pre>
<span style="color: red">Note</span> that &lt;&gt; stands for a place holder.
<br>
You'd better be able to tell the difference between \ and / in your command containing directories, or there would be errors like:
<br>
  <code>
    unknown command ‘\M’、unknown command ‘\b’
  </code>
<br>
The process lasts about 5 hours to 2 days, depending on the data size. Errors may step into the process, like:
<pre>
Error 1062 <23000> duplicate entry ‘20117321’ for key ‘PRIMARY’
Error 1064 <20000> row column doesn’t match
</pre>
I omit them due to lacking time to deal with it. When the source process ends, check to ensure if the latest data in the month has been inserted successfully, One way is to see the consecutivity of BID_TIME_DATE and SUCCESS_TIME_DATE:
<pre>
  select BID_TIME_DATE 
  from &lt;table name&gt; 
  order by BID_TIME_DATE desc 
  limit 10;
  select SUCCESS_TIME_DATE 
  from &lt;table name&gt;  
  order by SUCCESS_TIME_DATE desc 
  limit 10;
</pre>
When I insert data in April 2017, error occurs:
<pre>
  Error 1114 08171016 bid_record_*** is full.
</pre>
And only 700 KB space was left in the hard disk. Definitely it's time to migrate data to a <span style="font-weight:bold">real</span> server. For space limitation, I skip backup and restore process.
<h1><a id="link-to-anchor-3">Validation After Migration</a></h1>
A natural way is to check whether the number of records corresponds to the original database (we'll call it DB1).
<pre>
  SELECT SUM(TABLE_ROWS) 
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES 
  WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'DB1';
</pre>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>DB</th>
    <th>number of records</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DB1</td>
    <td>11.08*10^9</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DB2</td>
    <td>11.9*10^9</td>
  </tr>
</table>
So this means we have to inspect into every table to see specifically which table has problems when being backed up. And I tried these:
<pre>
  use information_schema; 
  select table_name,table_rows 
  from tables 
  where TABLE_SCHEMA = '&lt;DB name&gt;' 
  order by table_rows desc 
  into outfile '/comparison.xls';
</pre>
In comparison.xls, there are foughly 11000 tables, 7000 of which is the same in DB1 and DB2 regarding number of rows. I sampled a table in the rest of the 4000 tables, use 
<pre>
  select count(*) from DB1.table1;
  select count(*) from DB2.table1;
</pre>
and wierd things happen, these two tables have the same number of records! Apparently there's some difference in the operating mechanism between `select count(*)` and `select……from information_schema`. The reason is that information_schema.tables.table_rows is merely an approximate value for InnoDB tables. See <a href="https://blog.csdn.net/call_me_lzm/article/details/52244162">MySQL获取数据库每个表的行数
</a>) for more information.
  <br>
So I'm gonna use `count(*)` to check in a more accurate manner. But for over 10000 tables, looks like I have to write a loop in a sql Stored Routines(eg. functions and procedures) like below:
<pre>
  CREATE FUNCTION functionName(param1 VARCHAR(256))
  RETURNS FLOAT READS SQL DATA
  BEGIN
    /*A lot of blocks of codes*/
  END;
</pre>
but the following is a more friendly path for new comers, 
<pre>
  use information_schema;
  select concat(
           'select "', TABLE_name, '", count(*) from',
           TABLE_SCHEMA, '.', TABLE_name,
           ' union all'
           )
  from tables
  where TABLE_SCHEMA=&lt;DB name&gt; 
  order by table_rows desc 
  into outfile ‘/comparison_1.txt’;
</pre>
Thanks to this article <a href="http://www.111cn.net/database/mysql/45964.htm">mysql中查看数据库中所有表的记录数</a>. The `select concat...` will generate a bunch of codes looking like:
<pre>
  select "bid_record_***",count(*) from DB1.bid_record_*** union all
  select "bid_record_***",count(*) from DB1.bid_record_*** union all
  select "bid_record_***",count(*) from DB1.bid_record_*** 
  .....
</pre>
<p>
When you try to use `select concat...` above, do pay very close attention to those single quotes and double quotes mixing with the commas, for it can be very confusing.  `select concat...` generate a txt over 10000 rows, with a RAM less than 8GB, we'd better use `source` to execute this, and partition it into several parts then put them into execution in case the RAM is not big enough. At last, I combined these excels' outcome, named as count_all_DB1.xls, then do the same thing on the new server, we would get count_all_DB2.xls, then combine these two excels, and we can analyze which table's backup is in trouble.

At the end of this article, I'd like to share some knowledge on  information_schema table.
</p>
<p>
The SHOW commands are more common in daily sql tasks for most beginers. However, they do not conform to the SQL:2003 standard. 
MySQL 5.0 comes to the rescue with INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables. Using SELECT along with INFORMATION_SCHEMA, you can retrieve metadata from these tables about databases, tables, columns, and so on. INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables return considerably more information than SHOW commands. <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/information-schema.html">MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual CH24</a> offers detail discussion, including every table in INFORMATION_SCHEMA database.
