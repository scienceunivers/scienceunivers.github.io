This is the entrance page of my personal library. It is not only about books, it includes my notes on books, mainly existing with the suffix .docx or .txt. This is indeed a content or book list of one of the folders exported from my laptop or webdrive.

You can go through all the book names in this [个人图书馆索引](/files/library content.html), using ctrl + f to search for a book you're interested in, then if you'd like to get a copy of any book, let me know in person.

In future, I plan to upgrade this library, enrich its features, renovate this poor looking, making it more like a real library. But now we'd better take what we have at this moment.

<!---/files/recent readings.md，链接用这个的话，从内部access，中文有乱码。文件最前面加了编码声明不管用，但post就支持汉字。
可能是md在files文件夹不被渲染，因为点进去还是txt模式-->
