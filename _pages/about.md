What Is the Difference Between a B.A. and B.S.?
A B.A. degree reflects the liberal arts tradition guiding many colleges, Schendel says, which emphasizes philosophy, literature, history, social sciences, art and foreign language study. While a B.A. isn't devoid of math and science, it typically doesn't have the same emphasis on these subjects as a B.S.

In general, colleges can determine what constitutes a B.A. or a B.S. Some liberal arts colleges award only a B.A. but still emphasize math and science within their curriculum. That's the case at St. John's College, which has locations in Maryland and New Mexico. About half of a student's curriculum at St. John's consists of math and science, says Nora Demleitner, the college's president.
