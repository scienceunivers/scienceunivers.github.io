This is the entrance page of my personal library. It is not only about books, it includes my notes on books, mainly existing with the suffix .docx or .txt. This is indeed a content or book list of one of the folders exported from my laptop or webdrive.

For now, you can go through all the book names in this [link](/files/202308022323library content.txt), using ctrl + f to search for a book you're interested in, then if you'd like to get a copy of any book, please let me know in person.

In future, I plan to upgrade this library, enrich its features, renovate this poor looking, making it more like a real library. But now we'd better take what we have at this moment.
